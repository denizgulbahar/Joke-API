Jokes API
This application contains an API that provides access to a wide range of jokes. The API is designed to bring humor to your app by delivering jokes in various types and formats, making it ideal for enhancing the user experience.

Features
Multiple Joke Types: The API offers jokes categorized into different themes such as puns, science, food, and more.

Easy Integration: Itâ€™s simple to integrate into any application, providing a straightforward way to fetch jokes through a RESTful endpoint.

Random Jokes: Users can retrieve random jokes, making the experience dynamic and fun.

Customizable Options: The API allows filtering jokes based on text and type to tailor the experience to user preferences.

How It Works
The Jokes API returns jokes in JSON format, which can easily be parsed and displayed in your app. You can fetch a list of jokes, or just one random joke, using simple GET requests. Each joke returned includes the joke text, its type (e.g., pun, joke, etc.), and sometimes a setup and punchline, depending on the joke type.

Example Request
To fetch a random joke, simply make a GET request to:
```zh 
GET /random
```
This will return a random joke in the form of a JSON object:
```zh 
{
    id: 4,
    jokeText: "What did one ocean say to the other ocean? Nothing, they just waved.",
    jokeType: "Wordplay",
  },
```
Customization
You can also filter jokes by type using the following endpoint:
```zh 
GET /filter
```
For example, to get a list of Science type jokes:
```zh 
GET /filter?type=Science
```
This flexibility allows you to tailor the content to specific types of jokes or texts based on your app's theme.

Use Cases
This API is perfect for integrating into applications, websites, or mobile apps where users can enjoy humor, such as:

Entertainment apps: A fun feature for any app looking to bring humor to users.

Educational apps: To add some lightness to learning materials, especially for children.

Social apps: A great way to keep users engaged with random jokes or type-based humor.
